I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title url link description rating (1-5) I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) I can select from a dropdown (a element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection (Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list Technical Requirements Use fetch for AJAX calls and jQuery for DOM manipulation Use namespacing to adhere to good architecture practices Minimal global variables Create modules in separate files to organize your code Logically group your functions (e.g. API methods, store methods...) Keep your Data out of the DOM No direct DOM manipulation in your event handlers! Follow the React-ful design pattern - change your state, re-render your component Use semantic HTML Use a responsive and mobile-first design Visually and functionally solid in viewports for mobile and desktop Follow a11y best practices Refer back to the accessibility checklist and the lesson on forms


One last thing: If I empty my html out completely then I will need to change all the css classes in my bookmark codes. For now, I only have a header, a section, and a ul in the html, literally 3 lines. Also, before we started this assignment, our Course 1 teacher Terra said that an empty html is not required for this assignment. Please just let me go with it. Thank you.
